## Cosmerepass
Cosmerepass is a clone of the fitness app Classpass. Instead of finding and booking fitness classes, users will search for and book magic lessons in Brandon Sanderson's Cosemere universe (a fictional fantasy universe where the common thread is the unit of energy called investiture which allows for different expressions of magic-like powers).

Users will be able to browse lessons, check out locations, and filter by investiture type and location. Users can make lessondate reservations from the search page or reserve lessondates from the Location show page. Users can also read, write, edit, and delete their own reviews for Locations.
